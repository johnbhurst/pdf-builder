h1. pdf-builder

This is a Groovy PDF builder that uses the "iText library":http://itextpdf.com to generate PDF documents.

*Note:* As of the end of 2009, the iText 5.x code base switched to the "Affero General Public License":http://itextpdf.com/terms-of-use/index.php.
This license is likely to be unsuitable for many projects.
Thus, this pdf-builder project targets the iText 2.x code base, which uses the more liberal Mozilla Public License.
Note that the iText 5.x code base is source-incompatible with iText 2.x: package names have been changed from com.lowagie to com.itextpdf, classes have been moved/removed/changed.
Be sure to refer to the iText 2.x documentation when using pdf-builder.

The project is inspired by the "groovy-pdf project":http://code.google.com/p/groovy-pdf/, but contains all new code.

Currently the code is under development, and still in a very much alpha state.
However, we are already using it for some projects under development at a client.

We hope to follow up soon with:
  * Documentation
  * Samples
  * More features
  * More tests
  * Maven artifacts

Here's a Hello World from pdf-builder:
<pre>
<code>
import nz.co.skepticalhumorist.pdfbuilder.PDFBuilder

new PDFBuilder(new FileOutputStream("Hello.pdf")).document() {
  paragraph("Hello from iText.")
}
</code>
</pre>
